                <h1>1965: Snurfing is Born</h1>
                    <p>Believe it or not, this story begins in Muskegon, Michigan. It’s not exactly the place you’d think of when imagining the birthplace of modern day snowboarding. Most likely, you’d think of Colorado, Utah, or Alaska. But there in that place of rolling hills, lived a man by the name of Sherman Poppen.</p>
                    <p>One holiday season in 1965, Sherman Poppen got an idea for a present for his daughter. He had a steep hill behind his house in Muskegon, MI and wanted to give his daughter another entertaining way to get down the hill. So, he created the Snurfer.</p>             <p>He attached two skis side-by-side, tied a rope to the nose(s) for the snow-surfer to hold onto, and forever changed the snowsport industry.</p> 
                    <p>In 1966, he finally patented his idea. Instead of two skis, he used one solid piece of wood in the shape of a very wide ski. However, his Snurfer was shorter than a regular pair of skis and wider than two of them put together. He also added anti-slip surfaces for your feet since there were no bindings (we’d call them stomp pads now), and the rope connected to the nose for added stability remained.</p> 
                    <p>It’s supposed that in the next 10 years, over 1,000,000 snurfboards were sold.</p>

                <h2>2000’s and Beyond</h2>
                    <p>In the early 2000’s, all the momentum that was built behind snowboarding in the 80’s and 90’s was still being carried into the new millennium. It was now a regular sport at the Olympics and we saw people like Shaun White dominate the X-Games.</p>
                    <p>But then things started to change around the mid-2000’s. Resorts weren’t seeing as many snowboarders anymore. So what happened?</p>
                    <p>In this great story by Outside Online, they do a wonderful job explaining in detail the downturn of snowboarding. The gist of it, however, is that all the teenagers and 20-year-olds of the 80’s and 90’s were now starting to grow up. They got real jobs and houses and kids and responsibilities. But that never stopped skiers; what’s the deal with snowboarders?</p>
                    <p>The theory is that snowboarding comes with a defined image. It’s the image that those early pioneers made as 20 year olds, and it never changed. The baggy pants, straight-brimmed hats, and cocky attitude was the mold you “had” to fit in order to ride. As people grew out of that mold, they no longer rode but the image remained the same. It’s as if the image defines the rider instead of the riders defining the image.</p>
                    <p>So now we have an image that largely only appeals to the same late-teens to 20-year-old crowds. But those same kids are now picking skiing over snowboarding instead for whatever reason. The older riders are moving on and the new generation isn’t finding it appealing.</p>
                    <p>My personal opinion is that snowboarding is here to stay. Everything in the world is cyclical, and snowboarding is still a young sport in the grand scheme of things.</p>
                    <p>In the 70’s I’m sure it was viewed as a fad. Then it took hold in the 80’s. By the 90’s, it had made its first peak and declared that it is here to stay. But nothing can keep going up and up forever. There will always be a downturn at some point, and we are just now seeing the first one. Just as snowboarding was peaking and growing wild with popularity, I’m sure skiers saw their numbers fall and wondered why as well.</p>
                    <p>So will snowboarding take a hit for the coming decade(s)? Yes, probably. But it will weather the storm. There will always be a community of riders no matter how small it gets. And then one day, BOOM! Some new innovation or technology will emerge and it will come back on the upswing.</p>
                    <p>I mean… People are STILL buying Snurfboards.</p>
